# **Log Monitoring and Alert System**

## **Project Overview**

The **Log Monitoring and Alert System** is designed to parse, analyze, and monitor log files generated by an application or service. The system identifies specific events, patterns, and anomalies in the logs and triggers alerts based on predefined rules. This project is intended for backend applications and can be applied in both Web2 and Web3 environments.

## **Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in core JavaScript concepts, including synchronous and asynchronous processing, I/O-bound operations, and functional programming. The system is designed to handle real-world backend tasks, making it an ideal tool for startups that require reliable and efficient log monitoring solutions.

## **Key Features**

- **Log Parsing:** The system reads and parses log files, extracting relevant information such as timestamps, log levels, and event details.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** It can monitor logs in real-time, detecting changes as they occur and processing new entries without blocking the main thread.
- **Alert System:** The system triggers alerts for critical issues, such as errors and suspicious activities, and can generate summaries of normal operations.
- **Scalability:** The system is designed to handle large log files efficiently, making it suitable for high-traffic applications.

## **How It Works**

1. **Log File Input:**
   - The system reads log files line by line, using synchronous code for smaller files and asynchronous code for larger ones to prevent blocking.
   - Logs are parsed into JavaScript objects, categorizing them by log level (INFO, WARN, ERROR) and storing them in arrays.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - The parsed log data is processed based on predefined rules. For example, all ERROR logs trigger immediate alerts, while repeated WARN logs are flagged for review.
   - Higher-order functions are used to apply different processing rules dynamically, depending on the log level or event type.

3. **Alert Generation:**
   - Alerts are generated in response to critical log entries, such as errors or suspicious activities. These alerts can be logged to a separate file or sent to an external system (e.g., email notifications).
   - The system also provides summaries of INFO logs to give an overview of normal operations.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring:**
   - The system continuously monitors the log file for new entries, using asynchronous callbacks to process changes in real-time without blocking the system's main functionality.

## **JavaScript Concepts Applied**

- **Syntax of JavaScript:** Utilized in writing clean and efficient code, including variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements.
- **Complex Data Types:** Objects and arrays are used to store and manage parsed log data.
- **Synchronous and Asynchronous Code:** The system employs synchronous code for simple tasks and asynchronous callbacks for handling I/O-heavy operations.
- **I/O Bound Tasks:** Efficient file handling is implemented to manage large log files, with a focus on non-blocking I/O operations.
- **Functional Arguments:** Higher-order functions are used to dynamically apply different processing rules to log data.
- **Callbacks:** Asynchronous callbacks are central to the system's real-time monitoring capability, allowing the system to remain responsive even under heavy load.
- **JavaScript Architecture for Async Code:** The architecture ensures that the system handles asynchronous tasks efficiently, maintaining responsiveness and scalability.

## **Installation**

To run the Log Monitoring and Alert System locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/log-monitoring-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd log-monitoring-system
   ```

3. **Run the System:**

   ```bash
   node logMonitor.js
   ```

   *Note: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.*

## **Usage**

1. Place your log files in the designated directory (`/logs`) or specify the path in the configuration.
2. Customize the alert rules in the `config.js` file to tailor the system to your specific needs.
3. Run the system and monitor the output for alerts and summaries.

## **Sample Log Data**

Here is a sample of the log file (`application.log`) that the system processes:
